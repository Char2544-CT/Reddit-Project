HTML AND BOOTSTRAP

I emulated Reddit.

1. Bootstrap Cards- using Bootstraps card components I recreated the look of a post on Reddit. With the subreddit on top, a title under that, the content pictures/gifs displayed under that, then three buttons for upvote, comment, or share. For one of the cards I embeded a gif from giphy.

2. Carousel- In a single row I have a a vertical nav bar like Reddit, a Carousel for pictures being displayed, and another div for popular communities. Both of the columns on either side of the carousel disappear when the viewport gets small enough for better responsiveness.

3. Nav Bar- I tried to emulate the look and feel of Reddits Nav Bar. It is a sticky nav. Reddits logo links to home page, the search bar is justified in the center, and the login and signup buttons link to other pages. I used Bootstraps "pills" class to function as buttons on the nav. This also worked with just using buttons.

4. Login Button- Clicking on the login button leads to a table displaying popular Redditors. Table is striped and bordered for better readability. I also added a caption above the table so you know what info the table is displaying. 

5. Signup Button and Accordian- The Signup goes to a simple singup form with validation using the "required" attribute. There is an accordian underneath taken from the Bootstrap website to display FAQ's. 

TROUBLESHOOTING- It took me a while to get the Bootstrap features to work because I didn't realize I needed the Javascript script tag in the metadata. I meeting with my SSM quickly solved that.
